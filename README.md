Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a software Engineer working on various exciting projects. Below is a summary of my ongoing work with the tech stack used.

## About Me

üöÄI'm passionate about Afro and reggae music but I also welcome new music tastes and am keen to develop innovative applications that help in solving real-world problems in our society. 
üë©üèø‚ÄçüíªMy passion for tech runs deep as I have also loved to work on projects with  my mates and debugging is one of my expertise in the development world meaning working long ain't a problem.  
My latest project is an app allowing users to download videos from social media platforms seamlessly.
